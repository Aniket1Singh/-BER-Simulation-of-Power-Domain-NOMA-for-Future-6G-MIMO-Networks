This project simulates the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of a Power-Domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) system in a MIMO wireless communication setup, targeting future 6G requirements of high capacity, massive connectivity, and low latency. It models a downlink MIMO-NOMA system with dynamic user clustering over Rayleigh fading channels, using customizable power allocation and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) for decoding. Strong users decode and subtract weaker usersâ€™ signals to improve spectrum efficiency. Implemented in MATLAB, the simulation employs Regularized Zero-Forcing Beamforming and Monte Carlo SNR sweeps to compute BER across different user scenarios. A GUI enables real-time visualization, and outputs include BER plots and exportable results. The study highlights the trade-offs in power allocation and demonstrates NOMA's potential in enhancing 6G MIMO system performance."
